            <h2 id="about">About Alexander</h2>

             <p>When I finished college I taught high school English and then became a real estate broker. As a former teacher
        and real estate broker, I constantly have to think on my feet and come up with solutions to complex problems and
        communicate complex ideas to a diverese audience. That’s part of what I love about those careers.</p>
      <p>After completing the Thinkful boot camp I would like to join a team at a larger and more established company as
        a full-stack developer. Integrating my education and real estate expertise is also an area I’d like to explore
        as potential career paths as well.</p>
      <p>Reach out if you're looking to hire a new software engineer, or are looking for a partner to practice pair
        programming. I am so excited to begin my career as a full-stack developer and build great software, webpages,
        apps and more!</p>
